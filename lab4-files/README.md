# Assignment4 Concentrator

## Project Description
<!-- you can include known bugs, design decisions, external references used... -->
Can create a chatroom then whatever chatroom you decide to visit, the messages that belong to that room will be the only messages that will populate.

## Bugs
Currently it will keep populating rooms with the same name at home page, but when you click into that room it'll still only populate the messages that belong to that room.

## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

<!-- Put your answer to question 1 here -->
1. The ability to edit your messages, sometimes a user may mistaken what they aree looking to type and would like to change what they input.

2. The ability to catch cursing, in case a user is looking to have it appropriate for their kids and would want to filter out cursing.
